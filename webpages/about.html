        <p style="font-size:x-large">How Did Kandl Start?</p>

        <p>Kandl Started late one night, when Adrian Kracker, and Nate Laham were having a sleep over. Adrian had a great idea to start a buisness. Nate automatically said yes, and thus Kandl was born.</p>
        <p style="font-size:larger">What does Kandl Mean?</p>
        <p>Kandl Stands for Kracker And Laham. We put that together after thinking of unique ideas.</p>

        <p style="font-size:x-large">What are the plans for Kandl?</p>
        <p>Well, Kandl Hopefully will get started within 2023 or 2024. Nate and I still need to go to a trade school to get our degrees in Blacksmithing. After that we will stay in Michigan and serve the communities of Climax, Kalamazoo, Portage, and the surrounding areas.</p>

        <p style="font-size:xx-large">What does Kandl have to offer the community?</p>
        <p>Our services include: Blacksmithing, Pressure washing services for house and driveways, Lawncare, and Landscaping, Snow removal, as well as Concrete services.s</p>
